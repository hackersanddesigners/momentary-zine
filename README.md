# Momentary Zine

Hackers & Designers build an open publishing station. At this publishing station everyone is invited to co-create and examine editorial design matters such as cross-media publishing. Using a thermal printer (receipt printer) as a point of departure the visitors were be the subject of the accumulating publication and simultaneously active content providers.

Thermo print has the characteristic of vanishing after a while. With an easy hack of the printer software we capture the temporality and actuality of the event and printed matter as such. The zine content is exclusively accumulated by speaking into a microphone. With text to speech technology the spoken word translates to text. Simultaneously an algorithm is will run an automized image search on google, grabbing some of the words randomly and adding them to the zine.


## Dependencies

 * Install WK HTML to Pdf. Download here http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
  
## Usage

### Start the web server

  Download the momentary zine repository from github and unpack the .zip file https://github.com/hackersanddesigners/momentary-zine

  Run the following command in Terminal/Command-line from inside the directory/folder _momentary-zine-master_ you got from git. 

  ```$ sudo ./server.sh```
  
  If it asks for a password, it wants the pass of your laptop/computer. Don't worry it's in localhost.
  
  (If you want to stop the server, hit control + C)

## Configuration Receipt printer

### Install CUPS

  If you have a printer, particularly, a receipt printer or something with non-standard format, configure it with CUPS in the browser. CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by for Apple products. CUPS uses IPP Everywhereâ„¢ to support printing to local and network printers.
  
  Download and install the latest version for Mac: [via STAR Micronics manufacturer website](https://starmicronics.com/support/download/cups-driver-for-macos/)
  
  The receipt printer described here is a Star TSP100 FuturePRNT with cutting feature. 
    
  **Setting up the printer via CUPS**
  
  When CUPS is installed. Restart your computer. 
  
  Then navigate to this page in *Google Chrome browser*: 

  [http://localhost:631] (http://localhost:631)
  
  As the CUPS Web Interface may be disabled by default on your Mac, you will need to enable it in order to have your Thermal Receipt printers appear on the network. If this is the case, a screen will then appear saying _Web Interface is Disabled_. An indication that CUPS has been disabled on your particular Mac device. 
  
  ![Web_interface_disabled_00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7869045/159969739-04d4c8d0-4930-4328-84c6-a765ab6fc882.png)

  **To enable CUPS** 
  
  Open the application **Terminal** on your Mac. In the window that opens, copy/paste the following command and press ENTER.
  
  ```cupsctl WebInterface=yes```
  
  
  Now refresh the page in chrome with the url http://localhost:631, and the CUPS interface should show up and you can add your printer.

### Add the printer

Power the receipt printer (button on the left), and connect the USB cable to your laptop.
  
  Under _Administration_ you will see the button _Add Printer_
  
  You will be asked to sign in to verify you are an administrator of the computer you are working on. So you fill in the username of your laptop and corresponding password. 
  
  Don't worry you are running CUPS locally on your machine. You are only viewing this software via a browser window, you are not sending your details over the internet. You can also do this with wifi turned off if you don't believe me :)  
  
  You will now see a list of printers. If all went well it should say _Star TSP143 (SRT_T_001)(Star TSP143 (STR_T_001))_ at the top under "local printers"
  
  <img width="1680" alt="Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 13 45 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7869045/159970816-bc18b088-24a7-412c-b928-8a6c77785537.png">
  
  Select that one and press continue. Then select *STAR TSP100 CUTTER* and continue to select the right driver for the printers we have.
    
### Configure the printer

  If it is installed, go to _Printers_  
  
  In the dropdown that says _Administration_, choose _Set default options_
  
  * In _General_, set 72mm x 200mm as media size using the dropdown 
  * Go to _Cut Options_ and set both to **Partial cut**
  * Go o _Output Options_ and select page type: **Fixed length**


### Set printer as default on your system 
  
  Go to the printer settings on your computer and make sure STAR TSP100 (or whatever name you gave it) is set as default printer. 

Now you can use the receipt printer the same way you would use any other printer. In the print dialog box you can explore the dropdowns for different options like you are used to. Just make sure the paper size is set to 72x200mm. 

### Reprint jobs

CUPS will keep track of all your print jobs, this makes it easy to reprint a job without sending it again. To do so: go to localhost:631 again in Chrome. And find the button *Jobs* in the top menu. 

You will see a list of all your recent print jobs and what printer it was sent to. By clicking reprint you can reprint previous jobs. In most cases, reprinting via CUPS is faster and easier than going through the print dialog again. 

### Browse to (Only works in Chrome):

  Make sure the server is running by running the command ```sudo ./server.sh``` from the location of the _momentary-zine-master_ folder

  Now browse to the interface by putting this url in your Chrome browser
  
  [https://localhost/index.html] (https://localhost/index.html)

  Remember to give your browser permission to access your microphone.

### Voice commands
  
  Start speaking to provide content for the momentary zine
  
  Say the word PRINT to print a segment when you are happy with it.
  
  If the tool records more than 150 characters it will automatically print to empty the buffer.
  
### Check terminal if it doesn't print
  
  Is it sent to a different printer in your installed printers? 
  
  Go into system settings on computer and make set the Star printer as default printer
  
  You can review pending print jobs and error in the CUPS interface to for troubleshooting: http://localhost:631/printers
  
  If nothing works, terminate the server process in terminal by hitting CTRL + C. Then restart the server. 

## Changing the PRINT command to something else

The word print triggers the content to be printed, but is often misheard. You can pick another command to print the content by changing the word 'PRINT' to something else in line 38 of "server.sh"

```
if char_count > 150 or 'PRINT' in print_content:
```


## Changing font size and image size of print

In line 17 of server.h you can edit these parameters. Typically this is set to 280 px image width and font size 24 pt.

```
template = "<div><center><img src='THE_IMAGE' style='max-width: 280px;'></center><p style='font-size: 24pt; font-family: helvetica'>THE_TEXT</p></div>"
```

## Change language of speech-to-text

You can change the language of the speech-to-tech module in file "index.html", line 82. Change it to en_US for english, or fr for French etc.

```
recognition.lang = 'en_US';

```

## Removing images

This is a hacky way to make images not show up. They still get searched and urls get stored but not loaded in the browser, or loaded really small (1px width) in the printed content. There's a more thorough way, but for another day

To remove images from the browser interface: comment out line 27 in file "index.html" that say 

```
background =  'url(' + http.responseText + ')';

```
To remove images from the html and pdf files that will be printed. In the file "server.h" change the style for max width of images to 1 px

```
style='max-width: 1 px;
```

## Exclude GIFs

Gifs dont get printed. If you want to search for still images only, remove the arguments 'gifs' and 'anigifs' from line 53 in the file "server.sh"


## Python3 Support - Update

There is a new branch in github, in case you have python3
You can find the branch [here](https://github.com/hackersanddesigners/momentary-zine/tree/python3)
